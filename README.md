# BUDGETY :moneybag:

## A Budget Calculator Application:

* Budgety is a JavaScript project which I have done during the course The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects! by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. 
* The main purpose of this project was to learn and practice JavaScript language.

### Overview

* Budgety is a simple budget tracker app. 
* It allows user to input incomes & expenses and see how the complete budget changes due to custom insertions.
* It keep tracks of percentage expense done with respect to the income.

I am open to any suggestions about a code and how the app can be improved.
